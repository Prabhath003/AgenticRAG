## Quick Test Plan

### Test 1: Entity Persistence
```bash
# 1. Start server
cd api && python main.py

# 2. Create entity
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/entities \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"entity_id": "test_001", "entity_name": "Test Corp"}'

# 3. Verify file exists
cat data/api_storage/entities.json

# 4. Restart server (Ctrl+C, then python main.py)

# 5. Get entity
curl http://localhost:8000/api/entities/test_001

# Expected: ✅ Entity data returned
```

### Test 2: File Upload Persistence
```bash
# 1. Upload file
echo "Test content" > test.txt
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/entities/test_001/files \
  -F "file=@test.txt"

# 2. Verify files exist
ls data/uploads/test_001/
ls data/entity_scoped/entities/test_001/

# 3. Restart server

# 4. List files
curl http://localhost:8000/api/entities/test_001/files

# Expected: ✅ Shows test.txt with doc_id
```

### Test 3: Chat Session Persistence
```bash
# 1. Create session
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/chat/sessions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"entity_id": "test_001", "session_name": "Test Chat"}' \
  | jq -r '.session_id' > session_id.txt

SESSION_ID=$(cat session_id.txt)

# 2. Send message
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"session_id\": \"$SESSION_ID\", \"message\": \"Hello\", \"stream\": false}"

# 3. Verify file
cat data/api_storage/chat_sessions.json

# 4. Restart server

# 5. Get messages
curl http://localhost:8000/api/chat/sessions/$SESSION_ID/messages

# Expected: ✅ Shows "Hello" message

# 6. Send another message (tests agent reconstruction)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"session_id\": \"$SESSION_ID\", \"message\": \"Continue\", \"stream\": false}"

# Expected: ✅ Response received, agent reconstructed
```

### Test 4: Health Check
```bash
# After creating entities and sessions
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Expected: ✅ Shows correct entity count
```

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Run all test scenarios above
- [ ] Verify no syntax errors: `python -m py_compile api/main.py`
- [ ] Check disk space for `data/` directory
- [ ] Set up backup script (see PERSISTENCE_GUIDE.md)
- [ ] Configure `Config.DATA_DIR` in production
- [ ] Test server restart with production data
- [ ] Verify file permissions on `data/api_storage/`
- [ ] Review logs for any storage errors
- [ ] Test concurrent requests (multiple users)
- [ ] Backup existing data if migrating

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deploying:

- [ ] Verify `data/api_storage/` directory created
- [ ] Check `entities.json` and `chat_sessions.json` exist
- [ ] Test create entity endpoint
- [ ] Test restart with data
- [ ] Monitor logs for errors
- [ ] Test backup and restore procedure

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

1. Stop the server
2. Restore previous version of `api/main.py`
3. Restart server
4. Data in `data/api_storage/` can remain (won't interfere)

## Performance Monitoring

Monitor these metrics:

- [ ] Storage file sizes (`ls -lh data/api_storage/`)
- [ ] Write latency (check logs for slow writes)
- [ ] Disk I/O (use `iotop` or similar)
- [ ] File lock contention (should be minimal)
- [ ] Memory usage (JSONStorage loads data)

## Success Criteria

✅ All endpoints work correctly
✅ Data persists across server restarts
✅ No data loss during restart
✅ Research agents reconstruct successfully
✅ File uploads persist
✅ Chat history persists
✅ Performance acceptable (< 10ms overhead)
✅ No errors in logs
✅ Backup/restore works
